                <p id="chicken"> chicken is a lean meat with loads of proteins, it is also high on cholesterol. However, chicken provides selenium which contains antioxidants that help control free radicals and improve your immune system. A 100gms of cooked chicken would usually contain 239 calories. Of 100gms, 27gms would be only protein which is important for growth and development of various organs in the body. Besides, chicken also helps in maintaining the desired body weight. Furthermore, it gives zinc and iron and is an excellent source for Vitamins B6, B12 and D.
                    The protein content in chicken helps in decreasing bone loss. Bone loss is a major concern for women (aged 30 and above) and the geriatric population.  Consuming 100gms of chicken breast would be sufficient in fulfilling half of your daily protein intake. Furthermore, the phosphorus in chicken helps in maintaining healthy teeth, bones, and ensures proper functioning of kidneys, liver and the central nervous system.
                    Since selenium is present in good quantities, consuming chicken would mean increase in metabolism rates especially the thyroid hormone.

                <p id="beef"> Beef is categorized as red meat — a term used for the meat of mammals, which contains higher amounts of iron than chicken or fish.

                    Usually eaten as roasts, ribs, or steaks, beef is also commonly ground or minced. Patties of ground beef are often used in hamburgers.
                    
                    Processed beef products include corned beef, beef jerky, and sausages.
                    
                    Fresh, lean beef is rich in various vitamins and minerals, especially iron and zinc. Therefore, moderate intake of beef can be recommended as part of a healthy diet.
                    Beef protein is highly nutritious and may promote muscle maintenance and growth. Beef contains varying amounts of fat, including CLA, which has been linked to health benefits.
                    Meat is an excellent source of various vitamins and minerals. These include vitamin B12, zinc, selenium, iron, niacin, and vitamin B6.
                    Beef Provides a Large Source of L-Carnitine
                    L-carnitine is an amino acid that occurs naturally in meat products.Among other functions, L-carnitine plays a part in fat metabolism.

                    As part of this, L-Carnitine does the job of transporting fats into our mitochondria for burning.

                <p id="sushi">The Japanese have eaten sushi for centuries, but the sushi we know today originated as a fast-food option in Edo, Japan, in the mid-19th century. People could eat it with their hands or carry it with them as they went to the theatre. Visit a sushi cart or restaurant today, and you'll see two main kinds of rolls - nigiri and maki. Nigiri consists of a mound of vinegared rice topped with a dab of hot horseradish wasabi and a slab of fish, crab, egg, or other topping. A small, thin bamboo mat is used to roll maki, a cylinder of rice wrapped in nori seaweed with a morsel of fish or other filling in the middle. In general, fish provides a lean source of low-calorie, high quality protein. It's also low in saturated fats and cholesterol, making it a heart-healthy food choice. Salmon is especially high in omega-3 fatty acids, which are linked to improved cholesterol levels, lowered blood pressure, and decreased risk of abnormal heart rhythms. Mackerel, lake trout, herring, and tuna also have omega oomph.

                    The thin sheets of seaweed, or nori, which are flattened, cut, and wrapped around maki and hand rolls, contain mighty minerals. Iodine.
